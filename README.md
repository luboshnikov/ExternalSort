Sorting a large file of 32-bit unsigned integers.

##Building

To build using CMake: create a cmake-build-debug build directory in the project:

``mkdir cmake-build-debug

Then go to the build directory and run CMake to set up the project and create your own build system.:

``cd cmake-build-debug
``cmake ../

Then call the build system:

``cmake --build .

##

Add the "input" file to the directory with the executable file.
Run the executable file.
The result is in the "ouput" file
